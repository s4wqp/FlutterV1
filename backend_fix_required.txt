URGENT BACKEND FIX REQUIRED

Issue: "Data too long for column 'user_password' at row 1"
Severity: Critical - Prevents ALL user registrations.
Diagnosis: 
1. The `user_password` column in the database is defined as `VARCHAR(16)`.
2. The endpoint `/api/users` (or the internal logic) is performing a password hash (e.g., Bcrypt, SHA256) on the incoming password.
3. Password hashes are typically long strings (e.g., Bcrypt is 60 characters).
4. The generated hash (60 chars) > The column limit (16 chars).
5. The Database rejects the insert.

Solution:
Execute the following SQL command on the database:

ALTER TABLE users MODIFY user_password VARCHAR(255);

Verification:
After running this, the registration will work immediately with the existing App build.
